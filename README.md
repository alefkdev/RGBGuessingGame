# RGB Guessing Game

This is a simple web project that contains a rgb guessing game. given a rgb value, you must pick the colored block that represents the value.

There's a .php file that only exists to allow us to deploy the project to Heroku.

Here's the link to the deployed application:
https://alef-colorgame.herokuapp.com/ (Doesn't work anymore. Maybe I'll host it somewhere else later.)
